# A Next.js Blog with a Native Authoring Experience<!-- omit in toc -->

This starter is a statically generated blog that uses [Next.js][nextjs] for the frontend and [Sanity][sanity-homepage] to handle its content. It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration, instant side-by-side content previews, and intuitive editing.

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more. You can use this starter to kick-start a blog or learn these technologies.

## Configuration

### Step 1. Set up the environment

Use the Deploy Button below. It will let you deploy the starter using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-sanity-example) as well as connect it to your Sanity Content Lake using [the Sanity Vercel Integration][integration].

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

### Step 2. Set up the project locally

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) that was created for you on your GitHub account. Once cloned, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
npx vercel link
```

Download the environment variables needed to connect Next.js and the Studio to your Sanity project:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

### Step 3. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

When you run this development server, the changes you make in your frontend and studio configuration will be applied live using hot reloading.

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000][localhost-3000]! You can create and edit content on [http://localhost:3000/studio][localhost-3000-studio].

### Step 4. Deploy to production

To deploy your changes to production you use `git`:

```bash
git add .
git commit
git push
```

Alternatively, you can deploy without a `git` hosting provider using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```
