# Sanity.io and Next.js

This starter is a statically generated blog that uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) for the frontend and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) to power its content. It comes with a built-in Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration, instant side-by-side content previews, and intuitive editing.

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more. You can use this starter to kick-start a blog or to learn these technologies.

## Configuration

### Step 1. Set up the environment

Use the Deploy Button below. It will let you deploy the starter using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-sanity-example) as well as connect it to your Sanity Content Lake using [the Sanity Vercel Integration][integration].

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

### Step 2. Set up the project locally

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) that was created for you on your GitHub account. Once cloned, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
npx vercel link
```

Download the environment variables needed to connect Next.js and the Studio to your Sanity project:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

- [Bootstrap the example](#bootstrap-the-example)
- [Set up environment variables](#set-up-environment-variables)
- [Import to Vercel](#import-to-vercel)

If using the [integration] isn't an option. Or maybe you want to work locally first and deploy to Vercel later. This guide shows you how to set it up manually.

#### Bootstrap the example

Run the command [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/sanity-io/nextjs-blog-cms-sanity-v3
```

#### Set up environment variables

Create a new [Sanity project](https://www.sanity.io/get-started/create-project) and note the values for `--project` and `--dataset`, which comes up after project creation:

![Screenshot of a screen with a terminal command containing "--project ygjibjo8 --dataset production"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81981/195444377-dd497dc1-db90-4b08-843e-84df50a0231a.png)

In the screenshot above, the `projectId` is `ygjibjo8`, and `dataset` is `production`.

Copy the [`.env.local.example`] file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then set these variables in `.env.local`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` should be the `projectId`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` should be the `dataset`.
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` create an API token with `read-only` permissions:
  - Go to [https://sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage) and open your project.
  - Go to **API** and the **Tokens** section at the bottom, press its **Add API token** button.
  - Name it `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`, set **Permissions** to `Viewer`.
  - Hit **Save** and you can copy/paste the token.

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=...
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=...
```

#### Import to Vercel

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example).
**Important**: When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to match your `.env.local` file.
After it's deployed, link your local code to the Vercel project:

```bash
npx vercel link
```

</details>

### Step 3. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

When working locally, you can make changes to your frontend, and studio configuration. Your changes are applied live using hot reloading.

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! You'll be able to find the studio on [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio).

### Step 4. Deploy to production

To deploy your changes to production, you use `git`:

```bash
git add .
git commit
git push
```

Alternatively you can deploy without a `git` hosting provider using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```
