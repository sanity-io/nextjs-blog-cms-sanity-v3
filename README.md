# Sanity.io and Next.js

[main image placeholder]

Sanity.io is the platform for structured content. With Sanity.io you can use the open-source, single page application to manage your text, images, and other media with APIs. More! You can also use it to quickly set up an editing environment that you can customize.

Want to try Sanity.io with Next.js? This blog starter uses Next.js and Sanity which generates both the front-end and content editor so that you can jump immediately into action. The Sanity editor is React (with Typescript) which you can access by adding `/studio` to the url. It comes with real-time collaboration and instant "as-you-type" previews. Further down, you'll be shown how to configure ISR (incremental static rebuilding) for performant sites that can rebuild instantly.

You'll get:

- Next.js deployed with the [Sanity Vercel Integration][integration].
- Sanity Studio running on localhost and deployed in the [cloud](https://www.sanity.io/docs/deployment).
- Sub-second as-you-type previews in Next.js
- [On-demand revalidation of pages](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1#on-demand-incremental-static-regeneration-beta) with [GROQ powered webhooks](https://www.sanity.io/docs/webhooks)

# Configuration

## Step 1. Set up the environment

Use the Deploy Button below, you'll deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) as well as connect it to your Sanity dataset using [the Sanity Vercel Integration][integration].

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

## Step 2. Set up the project locally

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) that was created for you. Once cloned, from the project's root directory, link it to Vercel:

```bash
npx vercel link
```

Download the environment variables needed to connect Next.js and Studio to your Sanity project:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

<summary>You can also set up manually</summary>

- [Bootstrap the example](#bootstrap-the-example)
- [Set up environment variables](#set-up-environment-variables)
- [Import to Vercel](#import-to-vercel)

If using the [integration] isn't an option. Or maybe you want to work locally first and deploy to Vercel later. Whatever the reason this guide shows you how to setup manually.

### Bootstrap the example

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/sanity-io/vercel-next.js-examples-cms-sanity-studio-v3
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/sanity-io/vercel-next.js-examples-cms-sanity-studio-v3
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/sanity-io/vercel-next.js-examples-cms-sanity-studio-v3
```

### Set up environment variables

Create a new [Sanity project](https://www.sanity.io/get-started/create-project) and at the end note the values for `--project` and `--dataset`:

![Screenshot of a screen with a terminal command containing "--project ygjibjo8 --dataset production"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81981/195444377-dd497dc1-db90-4b08-843e-84df50a0231a.png)

In the above screenshot the `projectId` is `ygjibjo8` and `dataset` is `production`.

Copy the [`.env.local.example`] file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then set these variables in `.env.local`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` should be the `projectId`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` should be the `dataset`.
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` create an API token with `read-only` permissions:
  - Go to https://manage.sanity.io/ and open your project.
  - Go to **API** and the **Tokens** section at the bottom, launch its **Add API token** button.
  - Name it `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`, set **Permissions** to `Viewer`.
  - Hit **Save** and you can copy/paste the token.

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=...
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=...
```

### Import to Vercel

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example).
**Important**: When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to match your `.env.local` file.
After it's deployed link your local code to the Vercel project:

```bash
npx vercel link
```

</details>

## Step 3. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

When working locally you can make changes to your blog and studio, and your changes are applied live using hot reloading.

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! You'll be able to find the studio in [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio).

In case of any issues, you can post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).

## Step 4. Deploy to production

To deploy your changes to production you use `git`:

```bash
git add .
git commit
git push
```

Alternatively you can deploy without a `git` hosting provider using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

## How can I remove the "Next steps" block from my blog?

You can remove it by deleting the `IntroTemplate` component in the `index.ts` file (in the pages folder within the root of your project).
